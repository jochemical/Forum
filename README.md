# Discussion forum
The discussion forum is a small webapplication build in Flask where users can post their individual messages to discuss the issues about a statement displayed at the top. This project includes functionalities which are a good learning practice and can be used in many other projects. During this project I learned a lot more about forms and POST-methods and upgraded my general skills in HTML, Jinja2, CSS and Python (Flask library). Most importantly, I got familiar with the reading and writing to a MongoDB database to store the forum messages linked to the time and date of posting.
